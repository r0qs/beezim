    <h1>Welcome to BeeZIM</h1>
    <p class="lead mb-5"> We are uploading copies of entire websites to Swarm!</p>
    <p>
      BeeZIM is a project made by Racin Nygaard and Rodrigo Q. Saramago for the We Are Millions hackathon in March 2022.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project's goal is to empower people with an easy-to-use Dapp to upload a copy of a website onto a decentralized
      storage platform such as <a href="https://www.ethswarm.org/">Swarm</a>.
      Websites copied onto Swarm are resistant to censorship and will be permanently available, even if the
      original source disappears.
      In this sense, our Dapp has similar ambitions as to <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Internet Archive</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first release of BeeZIM, we are able to create a perfect mirror of the original source, including all (front-end)scripts,
      stylesheets, redirects, and images.
      In most cases, an end-user will not be able to tell the difference between the BeeZIM mirror and the original source.

      In addition, BeeZIM embeds a powerful search engine, which allows users to find content that is more relevant to them.
      Often this is an enhancement to the original source, as many websites provide a poor or non-existing
      ability to search.
      Everything works locally in the user's browser without communicating with any other server.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thankfully to <a href="https://wiki.openzim.org/wiki/OpenZIM">OpenZIM Project</a>, which is currently maintained
      by a not-for-profit entity named <a href="https://www.kiwix.org/en/">Kiwix</a>, websites can be highly compressed
      into a single file and easily shared by users or viewed in devices with minimal computational resources.
      Kiwix distributes archives for <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project
        Gutenberg</a>, <a href="https://stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a> and many more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The compressed files follow the <a href="https://wiki.openzim.org/wiki/ZIM_file_format">ZIM file format</a>, and
      according to Kiwix, the entire Wikipedia can be compressed in an 80GB zim file containing more than 6 million
      articles, with images!
