    <h1>Welcome to BeeZIM</h1>
    <p class="lead mb-5"> We are uploading copies of entire websites to Swarm!</p>
    <p>
      BeeZIM is a project made by Racin Nygaard and Rodrigo Q. Saramago for the Swarm WAM event 2022.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thankfully to <a href="https://wiki.openzim.org/wiki/OpenZIM">OpenZIM Project</a>, which is currently maintained
      by
      a not-for-profit entity named <a href="https://www.kiwix.org/en/">Kiwix</a>, websites can be highly compressed
      into
      a single file and easily shared by users or viewed in devices with very limited computational resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      The compressed files follow the <a href="https://wiki.openzim.org/wiki/ZIM_file_format">ZIM file format</a>, and
      according to Kiwix, the entire Wikipedia can be compressed in an 80Gb zim file, containing more than 6 million
      articles, with images!
    </p>
    <p>The main purpose of the Zim file format is to store websites content for offline usage.</p>
    <p>
      Our goal is to use the zim files to mirror websites on decentralized storage like <a
        href="https://www.ethswarm.org/">Swarm</a>, providing censorship resistance to the websites that we love so
      much,
      like <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> and <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project
        Gutenberg</a>. We want to make a version of the <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Internet Archive</a> that
      cannot be censored.
